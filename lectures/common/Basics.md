## What Is a Program?  
  
A **program** is a set of instructions that change or work with data.    
Data isn’t just numbers and text — it can also be actions in the real world, like changing a picture’s color, moving a robot, or sending an email.

## What Is a Programming Language?  
  
A set of instructions (also called a **program**) is written using a **programming language**.    
Most programming languages use something called the **structured approach** — this makes programs easier to understand and work with.    
Let’s take a closer look at how **structured programming** works.

## Three Basic Control Structures in Structured Programming  
  
1. **Sequence** — commands are followed one after another, from top to bottom.  
2. **Selection** — the program makes a decision and chooses one of several possible paths.  
3. **Repetition** — the same action happens again and again, until a certain condition is met.

## What Is a Variable?  
  
To **store and change information**, a program uses something called a **variable**.  
  
A **variable** is like a piece of paper where you can write something down and give that paper a name.    
But there’s one rule: each piece of paper can only hold **one type of data** — for example, only a number or only a word.  
  
### Example Variables:  
  
- `Birth Year` — 1999    
- `Name` — Abai
- `Age` — 25  
  
The word **"variable"** means that the information can **vary**, change.
