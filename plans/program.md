# Grade 1..4
Teach how to organize folders and files, how to not modify files of other students. (Maybe add password protected folders for each student using that computer)
# Grade 5
# Grade 6
# Grade 7
Should study exact models and their characteristics, what do they mean. Perhaps even make a pc [r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/))
# Grade 8
The main focus is OOP paradigm and design patterns. The projects should be sufficiently large. On student request I think it should be possible to switch to Kotlin because of preference, and Kotlin having great interoperability with Java. 
# Grade 9
# Grade 10
Continuous Integration and Development CI/CD, Agile, Notion, Trello, Waterfall
# Grade 11
Will choose which language to use, based on their previous experience, since the program in not tied to specific programming language. Java or Kotlin or Javascript or Python or C++
