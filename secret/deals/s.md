I am admiring your enthusiasm and activities as a teacher. I really liked how you invited people to enjoy their meals.

Even though I do not know you well, I value our little interactions

I have put thought to what give you as a present. At first, I wanted to give you a hourglass, as a metaphor of you being a teacher of history. But I was not satisfied with how hourglasses were made, so the present you have is a bit different.
