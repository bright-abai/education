# Theory

We are using decimal number system, that is the amount of digits before counting to 10 is 10.
`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`
What if instead of using 10 digits, we were using just two? We get a binary number system.
`0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001`

To distinguish between number systems, we can specify the amount of digits under the number (subscripting):

For decimal: 123<sub>10</sub>                      For binary: 100<sub>2</sub>

The reasons for using and studying binary system is electricity and computers. Either we have power on = `1` , or we have it off = `0`
