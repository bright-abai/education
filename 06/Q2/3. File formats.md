File can be of different types: text, audio, video, app, executable, app-specific, but essentially, they are just a sequence of zeros and ones.

To distinguish files, we are using a file format, which tells a specific way how these zeros and ones should be arranged to encode the information.

For text category we have:
# **.txt**, **.pdf**, .**word**

For images:
# **.jpg** **.png** **.img**

For audio:
# **.mp3**,  **.wav**, **.ogg**

For video:
# **.mp4**, **.mov**, **.webm**

executables: 
# **.exe**

app-specific:

# **.code**
