# Theory

>Write number, if it is even, write 0 to the right, else write 1.
>Write number divided by two without remainder, write 0 or 1 if it is even or odd.
>Till number is equal to 1.
>Write binary from bottom to top.

## Examples
```
77 1  46 0  123 1    1. 77  = 1001101
38 0  23 1   61 1    2. 46  = 101110
19 1  11 1   30 0    3. 123 = 1111011
 9 1  5  1   15 1
 4 0  2  0    7 1
 2 0     1    3 1
   1            1
```
# Quests
## 1. 👍  Convert 5 decimals
to binary, should be >99 and < 1000
## 2. 🔑 Convert 3 decimals
to binary, >999999 and < 1000000
## 3. 🏅️ Other way
to binary, but different encoding
## 4. 🏆 Conversion into ternary
think and explain how conversion into ternary (three digit system, 0 1 2) would work.
# Homework
Research how many number systems there are.
