# Introduction

CPU - Central processing unit, aka brain of the computer. It consists of many many parts which are connected together through electricity. It performs a huge amount arithmetics with binary numbers which allow complex programs to emerge. One of the main CPUs are logic gates.

Modern CPUs have multiple cores which allow paralleism: ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Moore Law of tech progress.


>Projection that number of transistors in an integrated curcuit doubles every two years
> Moore's Law

Current size of transistors is 5 nm

### CPU models

Intel, AMD, Apple, Qualcom - manufactures
