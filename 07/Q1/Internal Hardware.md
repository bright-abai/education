To accomplish the abovementioned goals of computation, information and automation a computer is frequently used. <br>
There are three main parts by which computer is divided:
- Hardware
- Software
- Data

> Hardware - interconnected electronic components which perform analog or logic operations on received and locally stored information to produce as output or store resulting new information or to provide control for output actuator mechanisms

> Software - computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer. Software can be defined broadly to include design documents, specifications, and testing suites.

> Data - smallest units of factual information that can be used as a basis for calculation, reasoning, or discussion.

# CPU

CPU - Central processing unit, aka brain of the computer. It consists of many many parts which are connected together through electricity. It performs a huge amount arithmetics with binary numbers which allow complex programs to emerge. One of the main CPUs are logic gates.

Modern CPUs have multiple cores which allow paralleism: ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Moore Law of tech progress.

Current size of transistors is 5 nm

Intel, AMD, Apple, Qualcom - manufactures

# GPU

GPUs - Graphical Processing Unit, used for rendering to the screen. 

Rendering - applying colors in realistic/stylistic way.

The main difference with CPUs is huge amount of parallel computations. When CPU contains 20 cores, GPU contain thousands of them. So this is the reason of its existence.

Factors for increasing price of GPUs
1. Games
2. Films, Architecture design
3. Cryptocurrency
4. AI (ChatGPT, AI art)

# Memory

Generally, there are two types of computer memory: volatile and nonvolatile.
RAM - a volatile type of memory (lost with the power), that computer uses to operate. 
HDD/SSD - storage memory, that is much slower than the RAM.

The term "memory" is used because application needs to store data. When one types into digital notepad, the text is saved in RAM, that is why apps ask you to save the file.

The memory is measured in bytes, where 1 byte is 8 bits

```
10101010 = byte (each zero and one is individual bit)

1000 bytes     = 1 kilobyte kB   1024 bytes     = 1 kibibyte KB 
1000 kilobytes = 1 megabyte kB   1024 kibibytes = 1 mebibyte MB 
1000 megabytes = 1 gigabyte gB   1024 mebibytes = 1 gibibyte GB
1000 gigabytes = 1 terabyte tB   1024 gibibytes = 1 tebibyte TB
```

# Motherboard

>_Motherboard_ means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities. As the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the _mother_ of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and [daughterboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_card#Daughterboard "Expansion card"): [sound cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card "Sound card"), [video cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card "Video card"), [network cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_card "Network card"), [host bus adapters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_bus_adapter "Host bus adapter"), [TV tuner cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_tuner_card "TV tuner card"), [IEEE 1394](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394 "IEEE 1394") cards, and a variety of other custom components.

`Motherboard` is a component that *connects* all computer parts together, and provides connection ports for the peripherals.

![motherboard](motherboard.jpg)
The motherboard also has a `power supply unit`, that converts AC into DC, in other words, provides electricity to all other computer parts.
