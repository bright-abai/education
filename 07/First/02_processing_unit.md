# Theory
CPU - Central processing unit, aka brain of the computer. It consists of many many parts which are connected together through electricity. It performs a huge amount arithmetics with binary numbers which allow complex programs to emerge. One of the main CPUs are logic gates.

Modern CPUs have multiple cores which allow paralleism: ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Moore Law of tech progress.
