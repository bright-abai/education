# Theory
GPUs - Graphical Processing Unit, used for rendering to the screen. 

Rendering - applying colors in realistic/stylistic way.

The main difference with CPUs is huge amount of parallel computations. When CPU contains 20 cores, GPU contain thousands of them. So this is the reason of its existence.

Factors for increasing price of GPUs
1. Games
2. Films, Architecture design
3. Cryptocurrency
4. AI (ChatGPT, AI art)
