[^1]: Grade 7 should study exact models and their characteristics, what do their mean. Perhaps even make a pc ([https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/))

[^2]: The main focus is OOP paradigm and design patterns. The projects should be sufficiently large. On student request I think it should be possible to switch to Kotlin because of preference, and Kotlin having great interoperability with Java. 

[^3]: Grade 11 will choose which language to use, based on their previous experience, since the program in not tied to specific programming language
## Notes

1. Think about adding something about Notion, Agile, Waterfall, licenses, CI/CD
2. Teach how to organize folders and files, how to not modify files of other students. (Maybe add password protected folders for each student using that computer)

## Questions for adminstration

1. Can we use a pirated copy of the book?
