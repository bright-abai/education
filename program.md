# To decide

1. Java or Kotlin plus Swift for mobile app development for Grade 8? (I am leaning towards Kotlin, not all of us has a Macbook or iPhone)
2. What program will be for Grade 6? Should Robotics be in a program for each grade, only a particular one?
3. I have removed codemonkey due to its trial nature, web based. Personally, I think пиктомир would do better.
4. Kids are not accustomed to such lessons, maybe add a game in the middle of the lesson that will motivate them (Not kahoot or blooket)

### Notes

1. Grade 7 should study exact models and their characteristics, what do their mean. Perhaps even make a pc (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/)
2. Think about adding something about Notion, Agile, Waterfall, licenses, CI/CD
3. Teach how to organize folders and files, how to not touch them. (Maybe add password protected folders for each student using that computer)
