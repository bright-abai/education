## Notes

1. * Grade 7 should study exact models and their characteristics, what do their mean. Perhaps even make a pc ([https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/))
2. ** 
3. *** Grade 11 will choose which language to use, based on their previous experience, since the program in not tied to specific programming language
4. Think about adding something about Notion, Agile, Waterfall, licenses, CI/CD
5. Teach how to organize folders and files, how to not touch them. (Maybe add password protected folders for each student using that computer)
