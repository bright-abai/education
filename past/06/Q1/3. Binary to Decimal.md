Each binary, as any number, is made of digits; individual digit in binary is called bit. Bit is either `1` or `0`. So number 10001 has five bits, two of which are ones.

If bit is `1`, then some power of two is present in the sum of its decimal counterpart.
The exact power of two is determined by the position of bit in the number.
The position is determined by counting from 0 and Starting from right to left
`10001 = 2^0 + 2 ^ 4 = 17`

```
101 = 2^0 + 2^2 = 1 + 4
1000 = 2^3 = 8
111 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7

76543210 = 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 = 128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 128 + 42 = 170
