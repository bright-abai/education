Generally, there are two types of computer memory: volatile and nonvolatile.
RAM - a volatile type of memory (lost with the power), that computer uses to operate. 
HDD/SSD - storage memory, that is much slower than the RAM.

The term "memory" is used because application needs to store data. When one types into digital notepad, the text is saved in RAM, that is why apps ask you to save the file.

The memory is measured in bytes, where 1 byte is 8 bits

```
10101010 = byte (each zero and one is individual bit)

1000 bytes     = 1 kilobyte kB   1024 bytes     = 1 kibibyte KB 
1000 kilobytes = 1 megabyte kB   1024 kibibytes = 1 mebibyte MB 
1000 megabytes = 1 gigabyte gB   1024 mebibytes = 1 gibibyte GB
1000 gigabytes = 1 terabyte tB   1024 gibibytes = 1 tebibyte TB
```
